### HTML Code

Looked for ways to do manual input. Discovered this link: https://github.com/geopy/geopy/blob/f495974c32a7a7b1eb433e7b8c87166e96375c32/docs/index.rst
Tried to create a manual input system. However, for some reason it won't link me to the Russian language version of the welcome page. Only the English one works.
